  The lecture video of Mapbox Application examples reminds me a little bit of using ArcGIS desktop to edit layer symbology and create custom maps. Mapbox allows users to create webmaps without downloading entire datasets and storing all of the shapefiles, which is awesome. <br><br>
  When thinking about what type of map I would want to create I remembered an experience I had during my Spring Vacation. My family and I visited Northern California, and we spent a lot of our trip travelling on the Pacific Coast Highway AKA California State Route 1. If you have not experienced this road, it is hard to describe how terrifying and beautiful it is. The road runs along the coast and is extremely sinuous with hairpin turns and giant drop offs where the road shoulder would be.<br><br>
  After driving on the road for an hour we all started to feel queasy and were ready to get off and onto another less frightening route. This was easier said than done, as the roads out were few and far between. When we did finally find one, it was a one lane road which turned out to be even worse than the highway we had left.<br><br>
  My idea is to create a map that highlights roads off of the Pacific Coast Highway which are considered major roads. This way a trip could be planned ahead, to make sure a safe exit is available before it's too late. Additionally, roadside attractions could be highlighted inlcuding parks, beaches, and small towns. Each layer could be edited to my symbology of choice. Perhaps I will make this map if I plan a future trip back to California.<br>
